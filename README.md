# Computer_Forensics_Investigation- A Case Study
Computer forensics is the implementation of the scientific method to digital
media to reconstruct the factual information for judicial review. Another term
for computer forensics is the collection and analysis of data from various computer resources including computer systems, computer networks, communication lines, and appropriate storage media for trial. The existence of computer
science of forensics is much needed nowadays especially in the future because the
number of computer based crimes can not be proven in real terms. To counteract those computer-related crimes, Computer Forensics plays a very important
role. â€œComputer Forensics involves obtaining and analysing digital information for use as evidence in civil, criminal or administrative cases. A computer
forensic investigation is an investigation where it checks the devices whether it
is compromised by unauthorized access or not. Computer forensics investigators works as a team to investigate the case and conduct the forensic analysis
by using different methodologies, software and tools. Computer forensic investigator must be aware of various laws and regulations and policies related
to cyber crimes in their country. Computer forensic investigation divided into
two categories. One is Public investigation which is conducted by government
agencies. Another one is Private investigation which is conducted by private
computer forensic team. This case study will cover only private investigation,
since an incident happened at a new start-up SME. This cases study includes
computer forensic investigation model, data collections, acquisitions, forensics
tools, malware analysis, legal characteristics of computer forensics. It also provides necessary recommendations, countermeasures and policies to ensure the
SME will be placed in a secure network environment.
